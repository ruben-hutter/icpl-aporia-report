\section{Conclusion}

In this project, we implemented a compiler that translates a subset of Python, $L_{if}$, to the Aporia language $L_{cfi}$.
The compilation is completed in multiple passes, each pass enforcing a new set of rules resulting in intermediary languages.
In order to test our implementation, a \texttt{run\_tests} program similar to the ones in the course was written such that the 
output behaviour of each pass could be evaluated and compared with the expected output.
The compiler was able to successfully compile and produce the expected output for all test programs.
