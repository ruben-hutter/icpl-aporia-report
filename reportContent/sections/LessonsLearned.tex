\section{Lessons Learned}

This project taught us a lot about problem solving, compilers, programming and working as a group.
It was a great experience to work on a project that was not only interesting but also challenging. 
We learned a lot about the different stages of a compiler, how to come up with them ourselves and implement them in Python.  
Overall, this project was a great learning experience and we are very happy with the results.
