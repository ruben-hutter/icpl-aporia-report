\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Overview}
This chapter goes over all of the compilation steps that were implemented to transform the input language $L_{if}$ into the output language $L_{cfi}$. 
The respective grammars of both languages are shown in Figure~\ref{bnf:lif} and Figure~\ref{bnf:lcfi}.
The compiler is implemented in Python and consists of three passes, each of which is responsible for specific transformations.
The following sections describe each pass in detail and show the transformations that are applied to the input program using the example program from Figure~\ref{code:lif}.

\subsection{First pass: Remove complex operands ($L_{if}^{sc}$)}


The first pass of the compiler lays an important foundation for each of following passes. It takes the $L_{if}$ AST of the original program as input and performins the following four transformations leading to the intermediary language $L_{if}^{sc}$ and its corresponding AST as output:

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{bnf}[row{-} = {bg = gray9}]
		cmp ::= != // == // < // <= // > // >=;;
		atm ::= True // False // var;;
		exp ::= int  // -exp // exp + exp 
		| exp - exp // (exp)
		| exp and exp // exp or exp 
		| not exp // exp cmp exp // atm;;
		stmt ::= print(exp) // exp // var = exp
		| if atm$\colon$ stmt$^+$;;
		$L_{sc}$ ::= stmt$^+$;;
	\end{bnf}
	\caption{Backus Naur Form Grammar of $L_{sc}$}
	\label{bnf:sc}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Remove top level expressions that have no effect:}
Any top level expression like a simple addition \texttt{1 + 2} or a boolean operation \texttt{True and False} is removed from the program because it does not contribute to any side effects. In the example program from Figure~\ref{code:lif}, this leads to line 2 being removed.
This transformation goes against the principle of Aporia, which wants to make the original program as complicated as possible but was necessary to simplify the implementation of the compiler.

\subsubsection{Create variables for complex conditions:}
The predicates in the statements of $L_{cfi}$ cannot be complex boolean expressions but only variables or the two boolean constants \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}.
Hence, if the compiler encounters a complex boolean expression as the condition of an if-statement, it creates a new boolean variable and assigns the complex expression to it. 
The compiler then replaces the complex expression with the new variable as the condition.
This transformation can be seen on lines 2 and 4 in Figure~\ref{code:sc}.

\subsubsection{Remove else branches:}
Each statement in $L_{cfi}$ can only have one branch, so the compiler must remove the else branch of if-statements.
In order to complete this step, the compiler assigns the negated condition of the if-statement to a new boolean variable.
This variable is then used as the condition of a second if-statement, which contains the else branch of the original statement as its body.
On line 3 of Figure~\ref{code:sc}, the assignment of the negation of the original condition can be seen which is then used as the condition on line 12 for the new if-statement representing the else branch of the original program.

\subsubsection{Turn if-expressions into if-statements:}
$L_{cfi}$ does not support if-expressions, so the compiler must transform them into if-statements with simple conditions and empty else branches. This is done in a similar fashion as in the exercise part of the seminar.
First, the condition is made atomic and the its negation assigned to a new variable as in the previous steps.
Then, two if-statements are created, one for the body and one for the orelse branch of the original if-expression.
Since top level expressions are ignored, the only context that if-expressions can occur in are print statements or variable assignments either as top level statements or to atomify a complex condition.
If the expression is part of a top level assignment, the variable name is given by the original program. In both other cases, the compiler generates a new variable name.
The result of the if-expression must thus always be assigned to the given variable name as the last statement of the new body in the new if-statement.
The whole transformation of an if-expression are shown in lines 5-10 of Figure~\ref{code:sc}.

\subsection{Second pass: Flatten and Make everything an if ($L_{if}^{flat}$)}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{bnf}[row{-} = {bg = gray9}]
		cmp ::= != // == // < // <= // > // >=;;
		atm ::= True // False // var;;
		exp ::= int  // -exp // exp + exp 
		| exp - exp // (exp)
		| exp and exp // exp or exp 
		| not exp // exp cmp exp // atm;;
		stmt ::= print(exp) // exp // var = exp;;
		if\_stmt ::= if atm$\colon$ stmt;;
		$L_{flat}$ ::= if\_stmt$^+$;;
	\end{bnf}
	\caption{Backus Naur Form Grammar of $L_{flat}$}
	\label{bnf:flat}
\end{figure}

The goal of this pass is to eliminate nested \texttt{if} statements, ensuring that all statements are wrapped in top-level \texttt{if} statements in the resulting intermediary language. We call this language $L_{flat}$, which inherits from $L_{sc}$ but restricts all \texttt{if} statements to be top-level only, as described by the BNF in Figure~\ref{bnf:flat}. Consequently, each \texttt{if} statement body now contains exactly one statement, which can not be an \texttt{if} statement, thereby preventing any form of nesting. The compiler takes an $L_{sc}$ AST as input and produces an $L_{flat}$ AST. Applying this pass to the sample code shown in Figure \ref{code:sc} yields the flattened version in Figure~\ref{code:flat}. The compiler of this pass makes the following transformations:

\subsubsection{Wrap every top level statement with if True} Any statement at the top level (i.e., not in an \texttt{if}) is enclosed in an \texttt{if True} block. This step ensures that every statement in the resulting code is preceded by \texttt{if}. We can see that lines 1-2 in Figure \ref{code:sc} transform to lines 3-4 in Figure \ref{code:flat}.

\subsubsection{Flatten nested if statements:}
When the compiler encounters an \texttt{if} statement nested within another \texttt{if}, it creates a temporary boolean variable that stores the conjunction of the outer and inner conditions. In Figure~\ref{code:sc}, for example, the nested \texttt{if} on line 7 is transformed into the conjunction on line 12 in Figure~\ref{code:flat}. The statements within the nested \texttt{if} block are then placed in a new \texttt{if} statement whose predicate is this temporary variable, as shown on lines 13–14 in Figure~\ref{code:flat}. By applying this process repeatedly, the compiler flattens all nested \texttt{if} statements without altering the program’s logical flow.
